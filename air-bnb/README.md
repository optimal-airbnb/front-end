☝️ Proposal

What problem does your app solve? People with AirBnB listings don’t always know the correct price to post their listings? Allow someone with an AirBnB charge the optimal price. Not too expensive, not too cheap. Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem? Our application looks at historical data to optimize AirBnB pricing in a given area What is the mission statement? Our application seeks to connect renters and relevant rental statistics/data

💡 Features

What features are required for your minimum viable product? Web Unit 1 Format of the website Connect websites together UI, mobile and desktop interfaces Web Unit 2 Build form page Get users input > API > get data back What data do we need from users? Web Unit 3 Create list of users, from forms, checked when login Send form to API Web Unit 4 Authentication workflow Web token Backend endpoint test Data Engineering Endpoints deployed to Heroku Data exploratory analysis Machine Learning Engineering Heroku app deployed Visualization, data exploration Training a model

User input and sending data Features: room type, minimum number of nights, location API Endpoints: Each user can only add to their own user, can see their own listing Optimal price: comes from Data Science

Backend- JSON web tokens, Knex, sqlite3, express and cors Data Science- FastAPI/Flask Machine Learning- EDA, Modeling, Modeling Log Do the APIs you need require you to contact them to gain access? Are you required to pay to use said API(s)? 🧮 For Data Scientists

Describe the established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day one. Kaggle dataset: NYC from 2019, takes housing/apartment data, boroughs, zip code, number of postings Write a description for what the data science problem is. What uncertainty or prediction are you trying to discover? How could this data be used to find a solution to this problem? Are prices regional? Ideal price to list for? If we are entering a certain area, what is our rental price? Seasonality, duration, bedrooms, bathrooms What kind of target output can you deliver to the Web teams to work with? Is it in JSON format or something else? Input: Zip Code (Location), length of stay, bedrooms, bathrooms, type Output: optimum price 🎯 Target Audience
