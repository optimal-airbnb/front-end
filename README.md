☝️ Proposal

What problem does your app solve?
People with AirBnB listings don’t always know the correct price to post their listings?
Allow someone with an AirBnB charge the optimal price. Not too expensive, not too cheap.
Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
Our application looks at historical data to optimize AirBnB pricing in a given area
What is the mission statement?
Our application seeks to connect renters and relevant rental statistics/data

🧮 For Data Scientists

Describe the established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day one.
Kaggle dataset: NYC from 2019, takes housing/apartment data, boroughs, zip code, number of postings
Write a description for what the data science problem is. What uncertainty or prediction are you trying to discover? How could this data be used to find a solution to this problem?
Are prices regional? Ideal price to list for? If we are entering a certain area, what is our rental price?
Seasonality, duration, bedrooms, bathrooms
What kind of target output can you deliver to the Web teams to work with? Is it in JSON format or something else?
Input: Zip Code (Location), length of stay, bedrooms, bathrooms, type
Output: optimum price
